Hello! My name is Karl.

I am a software developer stationed in Oslo, Norway. I am mainly focused on systems programming, but also enjoy functional programming a lot --- especially Haskell. This website is intended to showcase my projects as a way to both try to make them accessible, and to incentivise myself to continue working on them.

I am also currently in the process of writing my master thesis on the simulator framework [RINASim](https://rinasim.omnetpp.org/), where I'm attempting to implement a shim layer to send Protocol Data Units over legacy Ethernet protocols. RINASim is an implementation of Recursive Inter-Network Architecture (RINA), which is a clean-slate internet architecture that aims to figure out how the internet can be better.

My projects:

- [minishell](https://github.com/karlhto/minishell)
- [RES - a NES emulator written in Rust](https://github.com/karlhto/RES)
- [My dotfiles](https://github.com/karlhto/dotfiles)
- [This website](https://github.com/karlhto/totland.dev)

I use [neovim](https://neovim.io) as my editor, and encourage you to do the same!
