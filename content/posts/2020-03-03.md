## Website status

Welcome to my website! I am currently pretty busy with my master thesis, and have not had much interesting to put here since I started the site. As for projects, I have a couple (where very little is happening just now):

- [minishell](https://github.com/karlhto/minishell) -- a very simple shell written in C, written for a job application
- [RES - a NES emulator written in Rust](https://github.com/karlhto/RES) -- yes I know, very original. Also barely begun
- [My dotfiles](https://github.com/karlhto/dotfiles) -- if you need inspiration for your own setup
- [This website](https://github.com/karlhto/totland.dev) -- built using static site generator hugo

Up until a week ago I was also a part-time employee at Northern.tech, doing software development on the configuration management engine [CFEngine](https://github.com/cfengine/core). If you are interested in C development and contributing to tools used by big corporations to manage huge clusters of hosts, you should consider making a PR!

I also plan on changing the website layout and design to something more homegrown than [this hugo template](https://github.com/avianto/hugo-kiera) eventually.

Stay tuned! Some day this website might flourish.
